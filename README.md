# Lossless-Data-Compression
Lossless Data Compression is designed using Huffman coding, a Data Structure principle in python as part of DSA mini project.
Reduced the size of data by decoding and encoding using the Huffman Coding Algorithm.

• Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm.

• An algorithm proposed by Dr David A Huffman in 1952.
